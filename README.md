## What it does
Hoos Path helps women find safer routes and walking companions.  
Users can view nearby offenders on the map, create a “Walk Together” post,  
and get matched with verified users to walk together safely.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating Google Maps and the Directions API took time,  
especially optimizing route filtering to avoid flagged areas.  
We also faced difficulties setting up chat functionality

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully implemented safe-route generation and a working chat system  
within a short hackathon timeframe. Our UI design and verified user system  
also received positive feedback for being intuitive and trustworthy.

## What we learned
We learned how to integrate third-party APIs like Google Maps efficiently  
and how to design user experiences that focus on both safety and simplicity.

## What's next for Hoos Path
We plan to improve our safety scoring model and add real-time location sharing  
so users can check in safely with friends or family during their walks.
